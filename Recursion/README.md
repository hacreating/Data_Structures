**When A function calling itself the process is called as recursion.** 
eg. void fun(n){
       fun(n-1)
    }
    **Very Important points to Remember About Recursion :-  Recursion without base condition is a recipie for disaster ,
    that means Base Condition is very Important thing to keep in mind whenever you are applying Recursion.**
     *How Do You Know When to Apply Recursion ?*
 ***Ask 3 questions to yourself :- 
    1. Can it(Problem) be broken down to Smaller Problem?
    2. Are the Result Dependent on each other ?
    3. Does it have a Base Condition?***
    
   *Application Of Recursion*
   1. Dynamic Programing 
   2. Tree Traversal.
   3. Divide and Conquer Algorithms.(Binary Search ,Mearge sort, quick sort etc.)
